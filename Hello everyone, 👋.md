Hello everyone, ðŸ‘‹
I have built a mini-app, Birthday Palindrome?

This app checks your Birthdate is Palindrome or not. For this app, I have used:
ðŸ’¥ Reactjs
ðŸ’¥ JavaScript
ðŸ’¥ HTML5
ðŸ’¥ CSS3
I made my web development portfolio. It includes all my live projects (nodeJS projects, reactJS projects and VanillaJS projects) their source code, along with blogs where I documented my web development learning journey.
This all become possible with the help of a great mentor #tanaypratap #neogcamp #levelzero #tanvipriya #webdevelopment
Link of website is in comment. Do check and please give feedback and suggestions.ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜‡

Is Your Birthday a Palindrome?
Check out the below fun app which checks if your birthdate is a palindrome or not. Also, it will tell you the nearest palindrome date and by how many days you missed it. I made this app using Vanilla JS.

ddmmyyyy, mmddyyyy, yyyymmdd, ddmmyy, mmddyy and yymmdd.
